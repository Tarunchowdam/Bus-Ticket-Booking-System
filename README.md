## 🧠 Optimal Boarding Algorithm

To minimize total boarding time:

1. Identify the farthest seat row for each booking  
2. Sort bookings from **back → front**  
3. Board passengers in that sequence  

### Result

- Natural boarding time → **N × 60 seconds**  
- Optimal boarding time → **60 seconds**

This avoids passenger blocking inside the bus.
